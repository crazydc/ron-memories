# Ron-Memory

Cross-session memory using Upstash Redis with local file caching.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configure (see references/.env.example)
export UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=https://your-db.upstash.io
export UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your-token

# Save a memory
./scripts/memory-set.sh favorite_color blue

# Read it
./scripts/memory-get.sh favorite_color
```

## Scripts

| Script | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| [scripts/memory-set.sh](./scripts/memory-set.sh) | Save a memory |
| [scripts/memory-get.sh](./scripts/memory-get.sh) | Get a memory |
| [scripts/memory-list.sh](./scripts/memory-list.sh) | List all memories |
| [scripts/memory-delete.sh](./scripts/memory-delete.sh) | Delete a memory |
| [scripts/memory-sync.sh](./scripts/memory-sync.sh) | Sync Redis → local file |

## How It Works

1. **Write**: Saves to both Redis AND local `memory/ron-memory.md`
2. **Read**: From local file (fast)
3. **Delete**: Removes from both

## Configuration

See [references/.env.example](./references/.env.example)

Environment variables:
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

## Setup for OpenClaw

1. Enable skill in openclaw.json: `"ron-memory": {"enabled": true}`
2. Copy `.env.ron-memory` to workspace root
3. Run scripts from `/root/.openclaw/skills/ron-memory/scripts/`
